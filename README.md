You can choose any 1 of the Scheduling algorithm you want to use from our options

You can add process , edit values and most immportant thing we have provided a simulate button

When you click on the simulate button You will get Gantt Chart, Average waiting time, Average Turnaround Time,
CPU UTILIZATION and PROCESS DETAILS table in output according to input of you will give 

This image shows the OUTPUT for FCFS algorithm with default values set by us

The CPU Scheduler Simulator successfully demonstrates the implementation and visualization of five fundamental CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides an interactive educational platform for understanding operating system concepts with accurate calculations, real-time visualization, and user-friendly interface. The project achieves all stated objectives and serves as a valuable learning tool for students.
Key Achievements:
•	Five working scheduling algorithms
•	Interactive Gantt chart visualization
•	Accurate performance metrics
•	Responsive web design
•	Successful deployment

Thanks for Seeing our project and please try once you will love it; 

Because who not want to understand CPU Schedulling in an interactive WAY!


THANKS!
